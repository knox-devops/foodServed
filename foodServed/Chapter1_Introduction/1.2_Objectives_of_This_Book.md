## Section 1.2: Objectives of This Book

**Introduction**: The goal of this book is to provide you with a comprehensive roadmap for building a fully functional food delivery app. Following a **TDD** (Test-Driven Development) and ***BDD*** (Behavior-Driven Development) approach, weâ€™ll create a clone of popular apps like Uber Eats while ensuring high-quality code and user-centric features.

**Learning Objectives**: By the end of this book, you will:

Understand how to break down a complex project into manageable features.
Learn how to apply **TDD** to ensure that each feature is fully tested before development.
Use ***BDD*** to validate the app's behavior according to user stories and real-world scenarios.
Create a robust MERN stack application, complete with real-time features using WebSocket for real-time order tracking.
**Technologies Covered**:

**MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
**WebSockets** for real-time data communication

Cloud hosting and deployment
**TDD** and **BDD** Focus: This book emphasizes the importance of writing tests first:

**TDD**: Unit tests for each feature are written upfront to ensure functionality.
**BDD**: User behavior is defined using Gherkin syntax, and tests ensure that the app behaves as expected.
